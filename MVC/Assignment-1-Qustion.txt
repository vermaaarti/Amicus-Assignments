1. Create a new Asp.Net core mvc project. Create a controller named 'ProductsController' with the following action methods: 
      I. Index()
      II. Details(int id)
      III. Edit(int id)
     
2. Create corresponding views for each action method in the 'Views/Products' folder and use the appropriate naming conventions for view files, such as "Index.cshtml", "Details.cshtml", etc.
      
3. Configure convention-based routing in 'Program.cs' file. set up routing conventions for the "ProductsController" to match the following patterns.
      I. "/" should map to the "Index()" action.
      II.  "AmicusProducts" should map to the "Index()" action.
      III. "AmicusProducts/Index" should map to the "Index()" action.
      IV. "AmicusProducts/Details/{Id}" should map to the "Details(int id)" action.
     
4.  Configure convention-based routing in 'Program.cs' file which handles all the routing conventions using a single pattern.
      I. "/" should map to the "Index()" action.
      II. "Products" should map to the "Index()" action.
      III. "Products/Index" should map to the "Index()" action.
      IV. "Products/Details/{Id}" should map to the "Details(int id)" action.

5. Set up attribute routings for the "ProductsController" to match the following patterns.
      I. "/" should map to the "Index()" action.
      II.  "AmicusProducts" should map to the "Index()" action.
      III. "AmicusProducts/Index" should map to the "Index()" action.
      IV. "AmicusProducts/Details/{Id}" should map to the "Details(int id)" and input id should be integer with min length 3.
